Disclaimer
YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. THE SERVICE AND CONTENT ON THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. WE DO NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN OR SERVICES PERFORMED BY THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT ANY SERVICE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE AVAILABLE, THAT DEFECTS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY US OR AN APPROVED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. Wasted Selfie CANNOT ENSURE THAT ANYTHING YOU DOWNLOAD FROM THE SERVICE WILL NOT CONTAIN VIRUSES OR OTHER DESTRUCTIVE ELEMENTS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Limitations of Liability
Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Wasted Selfie or any of its affiliated entities be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages that result from: (1) the use of, or inability to use, the Service; (2) the performance of the services and materials available from the Service; or (3) the conduct of other users of the Service, even if Wasted Selfie has been advised of the possibility of such damages. You assume total responsibility for your use of the Service. Your only remedy against Wasted Selfie for dissatisfaction with the Service or any Wasted Selfie Content is to stop using the Service. If, notwithstanding these Terms, Wasted Selfie is found liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Service or any Wasted Selfie Content, Wasted Selfie’s liability shall in no event exceed $1.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.
Controlling Law and Severability
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to any conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively by the state and/or federal courts of the State of California, County of Los Angeles and/or the Central District of California. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of these terms and conditions unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.
Miscellaneous
Wasted Selfie administers and operates the Service from its location in Santa Monica, California USA. Although the Service is accessible throughout the world, not all services or features provided or offered on the Service are available to all persons or in all geographic locations. Wasted Selfie reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any service or feature to any person or geographic area. Use of the Service is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms and any offer for any feature or service made on the Service is void where prohibited. The failure of Wasted Selfie to enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. We may provide notice to you relating to the Service and/or these Terms by sending an email to your last known email address, and any such notice shall be deemed given and received on the day it is sent. You agree that any cause of action that you may desire to bring arising out of or related to these Terms and/or the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arises; otherwise, such cause of action shall be permanently barred.

These Terms are effective unless and until terminated by Wasted Selfie. Wasted Selfie may terminate these Terms at any time and may do so immediately without notice and, accordingly, deny you access to the Service, in Wasted Selfie’s sole discretion. The terms relating to Intellectual Property, Indemnification, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability and Controlling Law and Severability shall survive termination. You also agree that any breach or violation by you of any of these Terms will cause Wasted Selfie irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Wasted Selfie obtaining injunctive or equitable relief, without being required to post a bond, if Wasted Selfie seeks such relief under the circumstances. Such injunctive or equitable would be in addition to any other remedies that Wasted Selfie might have at law.
Complete Agreement
These Terms, together with the License Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding the same. No amendment to or modification of these Terms will be binding unless in writing and signed by us.
Questions and Comments
We welcome your questions, comments and concerns. Please send any feedback to Info@Wasted Selfieapp.com
Community Guidelines
The intent of this document is to clarify what we consider to be acceptable use of Wasted Selfie, LLC’s (“Wasted Selfie,” “we” or “us”) website, [Wasted Selfie.sh] (the “Site”), and Wasted Selfie’s iPhone and other applications (those applications together with the Site, “Service”). Redundant Content. Service is not intended to be an all-purpose content aggregator. Users who import or aggregate content in a less-than-meaningful way are likely to be suspended. Illegal Use. Service may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples of this include using Service for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site (used to obtain account and password information). Spam. Users that do not publish meaningful content, use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or whose primary purpose is affiliate marketing, will be suspended. Identity Theft and Privacy. Users that misleadingly appropriate the identity of another person are not permitted. Users may not post other people’s personally identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s and other license numbers. You may not post information such as other people’s passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web. Hate Content, Defamation, and Libel. Hate speech and other objectionable content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent. Note that an allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will remove that statement Copyright. Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in all cases. In general, however, users should be careful when using copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it. It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Mass Registration and Automation. Accounts that are registered automatically or systematically will be removed and access will be permanently suspended. Sexually Explicit Content. Accounts that regularly upload sexually explicit or pornographic material will be suspended. Malicious Bigotry. Don’t actively promote violence or extreme hatred against individuals or groups, on the basis of race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation. While we firmly believe that the best response to hateful speech is not censorship but more speech, we will take down malicious bigotry, as defined here. Harm to Minors. Be thoughtful when posting anything involving a minor. Don’t post anything relating to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent. Don’t bully minors, even if you are one. Life as a teenager is hard enough without the fear, anguish, and isolation caused by online bullying. Promotion and Glorification of Self-Harm. Don’t post content that actively promotes or glorifies self-harm. This includes content that urges or encourages readers to cut or injure themselves; embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or commit suicide rather than, e.g., seeking counseling or treatment, or joining together in supportive conversation with those suffering or recovering from depression or other conditions. Dialogue about these behaviors is incredibly important and online communities can be extraordinarily helpful to people struggling with these difficult conditions. Gore and Mutilation Content. Don’t post gore just to be shocking. Don’t showcase the mutilation or torture of human beings, animals, or their remains. Mass Registration and Automation. Don’t register accounts or post content automatically, systematically, or programmatically. Unauthorized Sweepstakes or Giveaways. Everyone wants to be a winner, but there are many reasons (including legal ones) why Service can’t be used for sweepstakes without our involvement and consent. If you’re planning something like this, let us know. Copyright and Trademark Infringement. Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others. If you aren’t authorized to use someone else’s copyrighted or trademarked work (either expressly or by legal exceptions and limitations like fair use), don’t. It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as per our Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Impersonation, Stalking, or Harassment. Treat the community the way you’d like to be treated. Don’t attempt to circumvent the Block feature. If you want to parody or ridicule a public figure (and who doesn’t?), don’t try to trick readers into thinking you are actually that public figure. Privacy Violations. Don’t use Wasted Selfie to deceptively obtain personal information. Don’t post content that violates anyone’s privacy, including personally identifying or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, unlisted contact information, or private photos of your ex’s junk (no matter how attractive). Disruptions, Exploits, and Resource Abuse. Our servers and the valiant engineers that support them work hard for you. Don’t attempt unauthorized use, disruption, or exploitation of Wasted Selfie or our other products and Wasted Selfies, or otherwise abuse Wasted Selfie’s resources. Unlawful Uses and Content. This one’s pretty obvious, but Wasted Selfie is not a place for illegal behavior, including fraud, phishing, or illegally inciting violence. Account Termination If we conclude you are violating these policies, you may receive a notice via email. If you don’t explain or correct your behavior, your account may be suspended and/or your User ID may be blocked. We do our best to ensure fair outcomes, but in all cases we reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without notice, for any reason, but particularly to protect our services, infrastructure, users, or community. We reserve the right to enforce, or not enforce, these policies in our sole discretion, and these policies don’t create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any particular manner. We also reserve the right to amend these policies.
Privacy Policy
Wasted Selfie, LLC (“Wasted Selfie,” “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy and the security of personally identifying information (“Personal Information”), including yours. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, protect, and disclose your Personal Information, Usage Data and Message Data (as those terms are defined below) when you use the Wasted Selfie website (“Site”) or any Wasted Selfie application or other Wasted Selfie service (“Services”). This Privacy Policy also explains how you can manage your information preferences. By using the Site or Services you consent to this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the content on, or privacy practices, of any non-Wasted Selfie entity, website, or service to which the Site links or that links to the Site.
Information We Collect
Personal Information
We generally collect very little information that personally identifies you, such as your mobile telephone number. We also have you create a username and password. You may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information when you register within the mobile application. The decision to provide this information is voluntary. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you will not be able to use the mobile application Services.
Usage Data
We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user but allows us to collect information regarding how users access and use Services (“Usage Data”). For example, when you download and use Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”). Additionally, each time you use the Site, we automatically collect information regarding the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site and to enhance and update the Services. We may ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile applications or Services. Your permission to our access to and tracking of your location based information is purely voluntary, and, accordingly, you may freely opt-in of or opt-out of and determine the level of specificity of the same.
